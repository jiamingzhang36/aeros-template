# AEROS Update Ledger

Purpose: track every meaningful AEROS template update against the project north star so drift is visible early.

North star:

```text
AEROS should automate low-risk research progress, preserve artifact lineage, enforce claim boundaries, and keep human judgment at high-risk exits.
```

How to read this ledger:

- `Alignment`: why the update moves AEROS toward the north star.
- `Non-goal`: what the update explicitly does not claim to solve.
- `Drift risk`: how this could become overbuilt, bureaucratic, or misleading.
- `Next check`: what should be watched in the next real project run.

## 2026-06-16

### 2026-06-16 — Kernel / Research CI

**Commit(s)**: `9ac6cfe`

**Action**: Added the formal research CI kernel, data-first layer, action receipts, global state view, event replay scaffolding, and adversarial kernel tests.

**Alignment**: Moves AEROS away from trusting agent self-reports and toward artifact/event/receipt-grounded progress.

**Non-goal**: Does not prove research conclusions are true or automate all empirical judgment.

**Drift risk**: Kernel could creep into a central scientific judge if future rules mix process legality with epistemic truth.

**Next check**: Keep kernel enforcement mechanical; put judgment in compilers, reviewers, and human gates.

### 2026-06-16 — Event Sourcing / Scope Discipline

**Commit(s)**: `bc0791f`

**Action**: Tightened event sourcing with hash-chain fields, replay checks, constitutional invariants, and scope calculus.

**Alignment**: Makes progress append-only and makes scope inflation visible before claims leave the system.

**Non-goal**: Does not yet fully derive every materialized view from events.

**Drift risk**: Scope calculus could become too heavy if every exploratory note must be fully scoped.

**Next check**: Keep scope enforcement strict at claim release, light during exploration.

### 2026-06-16 — Paper CI Phase 0

**Commit(s)**: `bc95c57`

**Action**: Added result-born provenance via `aeros.paper_ci.result_registry`, adapter contract, result registry check, and result record template.

**Alignment**: Moves paper CI boundary from manuscript scanning to estimation-call registration, so numbers receive birth certificates at creation.

**Non-goal**: Does not certify estimates, identification, paper-code consistency, or claim support.

**Drift risk**: Adapter contracts could splinter into bespoke plugins unless kept to one shared schema with tool-specific adapters.

**Next check**: Instrument one real estimation path and verify registry fields come from fitted objects or wrapper-controlled metadata, not prose.

### 2026-06-16 — Template Wiring / Paper CI Integration

**Commit(s)**: `18df986`

**Action**: Wired Paper CI and scope rules into AGENTS, templates, harness runner, manifest, architecture docs, revision log, and sync script.

**Alignment**: Makes the new integrity rules visible to agents and runnable by the default harness.

**Non-goal**: Does not run Phase 0 on a real SNAP or economics paper yet.

**Drift risk**: More template wiring can feel like complexity unless real projects exercise it and retire unused paths.

**Next check**: Use a real project fixture to see whether data-first and result registry reduce confusion rather than add paperwork.

### 2026-06-16 — Validation Project Gate Approval

**Commit(s)**: `9eeb698`

**Action**: Recorded MAHA validation project G11 design approval in the AEROS template history.

**Alignment**: Uses a real validation project to pressure-test human-gated progression rather than only adding template machinery.

**Non-goal**: Does not add a new AEROS capability or prove the template generalizes to all projects.

**Drift risk**: Validation-project commits can blur template evolution with project-specific decisions if not labeled clearly.

**Next check**: Keep validation project approvals clearly separated from reusable template changes in future update entries.

### 2026-06-16 — Update Ledger / Drift Tracking

**Commit(s)**: `pending`

**Action**: Added a human-readable update ledger, reusable entry template, and mechanical check requiring recent meaningful commits to be traceable.

**Alignment**: Helps detect whether AEROS evolution is drifting away from data-first automation, lineage, claim boundaries, and high-risk human gates.

**Non-goal**: Does not judge whether an update was good; it only makes the update rationale and drift risk visible.

**Drift risk**: The ledger itself could become paperwork if entries are verbose or detached from real project pressure tests.

**Next check**: Keep entries short and require each future capability update to name a real project validation path.

### 2026-06-16 — Paper CI Phase 0: implement adapter + de-risk sync

**Commit(s)**: `pending`

**Action**: Turned the result-registry from contract-only into working automation. Implemented the `python_statsmodels` adapter (`aeros/paper_ci/adapters.py`) that introspects a fitted object for estimator/formula/fixed-effects/cluster/values instead of hand-transcribed prose; made `sync-result-index` non-destructive (preserves curated columns and rows, backs up before overwrite) to remove a data-loss footgun; added a missing-artifact warning to `event append`; labeled paper-ci maturity honestly in the adapter contract.

**Alignment**: Directly serves the north star — automates a low-risk, mechanical step (numbers born with spec provenance) and removes a path that could silently destroy a hand-curated index.

**Non-goal**: Does not prove identification, does not approve claims, and is still not validated on a live project pipeline (CMPD vendors an older aeros without paper-ci; install/sync is required first).

**Drift risk**: Per-library bespoke adapters could re-complicate things; keep them behind the single adapter contract. The feature still has zero real-project validation, so it must not be presented as a finished capability.

**Next check**: Run Phase 0 end to end on one real CMPD estimate (after unifying the aeros install) and confirm the registered number round-trips into result_index without losing curated metadata.

### 2026-06-16 — Framework propagation discipline

**Commit(s)**: `pending`

**Action**: Added a "Framework Propagation Discipline" section to AGENTS.md: propagate framework code to vendored project copies only via `tools/sync_aeros_latest.zsh` (forward-only, non-destructive), commit target WIP before syncing, and never hand-copy framework files or relocate project-owned files out of `aeros/`.

**Alignment**: Attacks the actual root cause of recent drift — projects running divergent, hand-synced copies of aeros — by making one mechanism authoritative. Serves the north star by keeping every project on current, verifiable framework code.

**Non-goal**: Does not itself run the sync or reconcile already-diverged projects; it only sets the rule so divergence stops accumulating.

**Drift risk**: A rule no one runs is paperwork. This must be paired with actually running the sync after template changes — verified by projects not falling behind on framework code, not by the rule's existence.

**Next check**: After the next template change, confirm CMPD and other targets were brought current via the sync tool (not by hand) and that their framework code matches this template.
